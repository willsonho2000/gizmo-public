# ----- Radiation-Hydrodynamics Special Options for Test Problems + Disabled or Other Special Features
#RT_DISABLE_UV_BACKGROUND               # disable extenal UV background in cooling functions (to isolate pure effects of local RT, or if simulating the background directly)
#RT_DIFFUSION_CG_MODIFY_EDDINGTON_TENSOR # when RT_DIFFUSION_IMPLICIT is enabled, modifies the Eddington tensor to the fully anisotropic version (less stable CG iteration)
#RT_SEPARATELY_TRACK_LUMPOS             # keep luminosity vs. mass positions separate in tree. not compatible with Tree-PM mode, but it can be slightly more accurate and useful for debugging in tree-only mode with LEBRON or OTVET algorithms.
#RT_DISABLE_FLUXLIMITER                 # removes the flux-limiter from the diffusion operations (default is to include it when using the relevant approximations)
#RT_HYDROGEN_GAS_ONLY                   # sets hydrogen fraction to 1.0 (used for certain idealized chemistry calculations)
#RT_COOLING_PHOTOHEATING_OLDFORMAT      # includes photoheating and cooling (using RT information), doing just the photo-heating [for more general cooling physics, enable COOLING]
#RT_FIRE_FIX_SPECTRAL_SHAPE             # enable with GALSF_FB_FIRE_RT_LONGRANGE to use a fixed SED shape set in parameterfile for all incident fluxes
#RT_TIMESTEP_LIMIT_RECOMBINATION        # limit timesteps to the explicit recombination time when transporting ionizing photons. note our chemistry solvers are all implicit and can handle larger timesteps, but no gaurantee of transport accuracy for much larger steps since opacities depend on ionization states.
#RT_ENHANCED_NUMERICAL_DIFFUSION        # option which increases numerical diffusion, to get smoother solutions (akin to using HLL instead of HLLC+E fluxes), if desired; akin to slopelimiters~0 model
#RT_COMPGRAD_EDDINGTON_TENSOR           # forces computation of eddington tensor even when not needed by the code
#RT_REINJECT_ACCRETED_PHOTONS           # when sink particles are used, photons lost when a gas cell is accreted are reinjected into the lowest-energy frequency bin on the following photon injection from that sink
# --------------------
# ----- Black hole/sink particle special options
#BH_WIND_SPAWN_SET_BFIELD_POLTOR  # set poloridal and toroidal magnetic field for spawn particles (should work for all particle spawning). Cite Su et al., arXiv:2102.02206, for methods.

#BH_DEBUG_SPAWN_JET_TEST=(30.)    # BH outflow/particle spawn in jet  (initial position isotropic around BH, vel within narrow angle specified in () in degree, testing/early-dev, doesn't work for general problems!).  Cite Su et al., arXiv:2102.02206, for methods.
#BH_DEBUG_FIX_MDOT_MBH=(0.2)      # fix BH fb mass flux and fixed BH mass.  Cite Su et al., arXiv:2102.02206, for methods.

#BH_RIAF_SUBEDDINGTON_MODEL       # enable an arbitrary modular variation in the radiative efficiency of BHs as a function of eddington ratio or other particle properties
#BH_CR_SUBEDDINGTON_MODEL         # enable an arbitrary modular variation in the CR acceleration efficiency from BHs as a function of mass, eddington ratio, spin, or other particle properties
#BH_SCALE_SPAWNINGMASS_WITH_INITIALMASS # rescale the cell spawning mass criterion to scale with the initial sink mass for any sink and sink feedback model (instead of setting the spawning mass to a fixed universal constant in code units).
#BH_EXCISION_NONGAS               # excise non-gas elements too close to a sink if they meet various criteria including being bound, sufficiently old (if stars), within and with maximum possible apocentric radii within the sink softening (which is rescaled appropriately). mass is added to the sink dynamical mass reservoir, not disk or sink itself. developed by PFH; cite arXiv:2203.00040
#BH_EXCISION_GAS                  # excise gas elements too close to a sink with a similar criterion to BH_EXCISION_NONGAS (same references and details apply)

#SINGLE_STAR_FB_TIMESTEPLIMIT     # limit the timesteps in gas cells potentially interacting with sink particles in the SINGLE_STAR modules, so that they cannot take timesteps large compared to quantities like the time for jets/winds to cross from the sink to the gas cell
# --------------------
# ----- Cosmic ray special options
#CRFLUID_ALT_SPECTRUM_SPECIALSNAPRESTART=1  # allows restart from a snapshot (flag=2) where single-bin CR model was used, for runs with CR spectra: the spectra are populated with the energy of the single-bin snapshot and fixed initial spectral shapes/ratios
#CRFLUID_ALT_DISABLE_STREAMING      # turn off CR streaming (propagation is purely advective+diffusion; this also disables losses from gyro-resonant instabilities)
#CRFLUID_ALT_DISABLE_LOSSES         # turn off CR heating/cooling interactions with gas (catastrophic losses, hadronic interactions, etc; only adiabatic/D:GradU work terms remain)
#CRFLUID_ALT_M1_ISO_CLOSURE         # replace the more accurate default M1-like closure relation (which interpolates between the strong-scattering/isotropic-DF and free-streaming/anisotropic-DF regimes) with a closure that assumes the CR DF is always isotropic. beware that this can cause unphysical behaviors in some regimes.
#CRFLUID_ALT_FLUX_FORM_JOCH         # replace the form of the two-moment CR equations derived directly from the focused CR transport equation (per Hopkins et al. 2021), with the older formulation of the two-moment equations derived ad-hoc (missing some important terms) from Jiang+Oh & Chan+Hopkins 2018. If this is used, cite Chan et al. 2019 2019MNRAS.488.3716C for the numerical methods
#CRFLUID_ALT_VARIABLE_RSOL          # allows a variable (CR energy-dependent) reduced speed of light to be used for CRs, which is set in the function return_CRbin_M1speed defined by the user. cite Hopkins et al. 2021, arXiv:2103.10443
#CRFLUID_BINCENTERED_TRANSPORT      # use the older 'bin-centered' cosmic ray transport scheme for spectrally-resolved cosmic rays, instead of the more accurate scheme which prevents bin-to-bin artifacts as developed in Hopkins arXiv:2202.05283
# --------------------
# ----- FIRE and STARFORGE sub-module special options
#FIRE_SNE_ENERGY_METAL_DEPENDENCE_EXPERIMENT # experiment with modified supernova energies as a function of metallicity - freely modify this module as desired. used for numerical experiments only.
#SINGLE_STAR_AND_SSP_HYBRID_MODEL=1 # cells with mass less than this (in solar) are treated with the single-stellar evolution models, larger mass with ssp models. needs user to specify a refinement criterion, and a criterion for when one module or another will be used. still in testing.
#STARFORGE_GMC_TURBINIT             # special flag for custom ICs behavior in star formation simulations for turbulent clouds. adds an analytic uniform sphere harmonic potential + r^-3 halo outside to confine stirred turbulent gas, during the 'stirring' phase. cite Lane et al., 2022MNRAS.510.4767L
#STARFORGE_FILAMENT_TURBINIT        # special flag for custom ICs behavior in star formation simulations for turbulent clouds. adds an analytic potential of an finitite cylinder with a Plummer density profile, truncated at the ends of the cylinder, to confine stirred turbulent gas, during the 'stirring' phase. cite Lane et al., 2022MNRAS.510.4767L
#STARFORGE_FEEDBACK_TRACERS         # adds tracer fields to recycled gas in the SINGLE_STAR modules to explicitly track gas coming from jets versus main-sequence winds versus supernovae. tracer fields added to metal fields
# --------------------
# ----- Dust grain/particulate/aerosol module special options
#GRAIN_RDI_TESTPROBLEM_ACCEL_DEPENDS_ON_SIZE    # Make the idealized external grain acceleration grain size-dependent; equivalent to assuming an absorption efficiency Q=1. Cite GRAIN_RDI_TESTPROBLEM papers.
#GRAIN_RDI_TESTPROBLEM_LIVE_RADIATION_INJECTION # Enables idealized radiation injection by a source population designed to set up outflow test problems with live radiation-hydrodynamics as in Hopkins et al., arXiv:2107.04608. Cite that paper if this module is used.
# --------------------
# ----- MPI & Parallel-FFTW De-Bugging
#USE_MPI_IN_PLACE               # MPI debugging: makes AllGatherV compatible with MPI_IN_PLACE definitions in some MPI libraries
#NO_ISEND_IRECV_IN_DOMAIN       # MPI debugging: slower, but fixes memory errors during exchange in the domain decomposition (ANY RUN with >2e9 particles MUST SET THIS OR FAIL!)
#FIX_PATHSCALE_MPI_STATUS_IGNORE_BUG # MPI debugging
#MPISENDRECV_SIZELIMIT=100      # MPI debugging: force all MPI_Sendrecv calls to use the "size-limited" version which checks for the minimum of int, buffersize, or this value in MB as the maximum number of bytes it can send/receive (otherwise it breaks it into chunks). should never hurt, just gives slightly slower communication calls because of the extra checks.
#MPISENDRECV_CHECKSUM           # MPI debugging: force all MPI_Sendrecv calls to use the "checksummed" version which checks for communication and appropriate values. useful for debugging but not normally desired (adds a significant cost multiplier)
#DONOTUSENODELIST               # MPI debugging
#NOTYPEPREFIX_FFTW              # FFTW debugging (fftw-header/libraries accessed without type prefix, adopting whatever was chosen as default at compile of fftw). Otherwise, the type prefix 'd' for double is used.
#USE_FFTW3                      # enables FFTW3 (can be used with DOUBLEPRECISION_FFTW). Thanks to Takashi Okamoto.
#DOUBLEPRECISION_FFTW           # FFTW in double precision to match libraries
#DISABLE_ALIGNED_ALLOC          # disable calls to 'aligned_alloc', needed for older C99-only versions of GCC compilers [everything C11+ -should- be compatible and not need this]
# --------------------
# ----- Load-Balancing
#ALLOW_IMBALANCED_GASPARTICLELOAD # increases All.MaxPartGas to All.MaxPart: can allow better load-balancing in some cases, but uses more memory. But use me if you run into errors where it can't fit the domain (where you would increase PartAllocFac, but can't for some reason)
#SEPARATE_STELLARDOMAINDECOMP   # separate stars (ptype=4+5) and other non-gas particles in domain decomposition (may help load-balancing)
